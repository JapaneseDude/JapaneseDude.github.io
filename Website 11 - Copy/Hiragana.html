<p>Hiragana is one of three Japanese alphabets, and is the most important one. It can be considered the foundation of the language, and also an important step for learning Japanese. It is, in multiple respects, the first step to learning Japanese. Hiragana is relatively simple, having 42 characters each with unique sounds.</p>
    
<p>Being the foundation of the language, knowing Hiragana will allow you to communicate with most if not all Japanese people to an extent. Typically, Hiragana is quite easy to spot, with its curvy shapes and relatively simplistic structure, being quite different to the symmetrical characters found in Korean or the more complex-looking characters in Chinese.</p>
    
<p>An important thing to remember, is to learn at your own pace. As emphasised before, it <i>will</i> take some time, and rushing through it could result in you forgetting some things.</p>

<div class="header">Starting out</div>
    
<p>Though the thought of having to learn a whole new alphabet full of alien looking characters and different sounds may seem a bit overwhelming at first, everything has a process, and learning Hiragana is no exception. as noted before, whether you are taking Japanese as a school subject or simply wanting to learn a language, it is important to learn at your own pace. The reason I have emphasised this point multiple times, is because learning in classes or with text books can be restricting and/or frustrating, as you may not be able to understand everything, or maybe everyone else is slower than you. I, personally, recommend reading <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/?utm_source=Tofugu&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=Learn%20Japanese">This Article</a> from <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/">Tofugu</a> as a start.</p>
        
<p>The article consists of various tips and tricks that will help when learning Hiragana, and also includes other useful learning resources such as videos to assist learning. I recommend reading online articles such as those, as not only can you learn at your own pace, but you can also look back on them whenever necessary. Though these articles and websites are useful, they only serve as an "instruction manual" and still require you to spend time constructing and exercising your knowledge.</p>

<div class="header">Obstacles</div>

<p>Sometimes, when learning something, there are some things that are difficult to do by yourself. If you ever find yourself in a slump, don't be scared to ask for help. learning will always come with obstacles, and especially when learning a language, these obstacles can be frustrating. A simple yet effective way to get over these obstacles, is by talking face to face with someone that knows the language well. As simple as it may sound, it can be quite insightful in many ways. </p>
