<p>The second alphabet of Japanese, is Katakana. Katakana is practically exactly the same as Hiragana, the only difference being the use and appearance. Katakana works on the same principals as Hiragana, so if you have already learnt Hiragana, learning Katakana will be relatively easy. You may be wondering why they made a whole different alphabet only for it to be basicaly the same as Hiragana, but there is a reason behind this. </p>

<div class="header">Similarities and Differences</div>    
    
<p>Hiragana, as stated before, is the main alphabet for Japanese, being used to make words etc. However, there are some words that do not exist in Japanese, or are from a foreign language. an example of this would be the word "Cheese". strangely enough, in Japanese, there is no word for "Cheese", which is where Katakana comes in. When a foreign word is in written form (e.g. on paper or computer), it will always be in Katakana. This rule applies to words from languages other than English as well, and may be confusing at first, but is a very practical alphabet.</p>
    
<p>As stated before, the difference between Hiragana and Katakana is 1: the use, and 2: the appearance. Unlike Hiragana, Katakana has a more jagged and sharp appearance, being relatively easy to differentiate from the squiggly and curvy shape of Hiragana. For further information on Katakana, its uses, and how to learn it, be sure to read <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/>">this article</a>, also from Tofugu.</p>
    
<div class="header">There's still a lot more...</div>
    
<p>Thank you for reading up to this point in the website. As stated above, there is still a whole lot more to Japanese than what I have covered on this website. Again, this is just a starting point to learning the language, and for those that wish to further expand their knowledge on the Japanese language, I wish you the best of luck. You will most likely be faced with more obstacles as you go on to further your understanding of the Japanese language, so when you do, remember; it will take time, however, working at your own pace is the best thing you can do.</p>
