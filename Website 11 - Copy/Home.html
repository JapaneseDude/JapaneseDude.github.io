    <b1>Hello and welcome to the Japanese Study Guide Website, made by Alex Yoshikane. Whatever the reason may be, learning a new language can be difficult. This is especially the case with languages such as Japanese, where the grammatical structure of the language is very different to English. This website is for beginners that want to start learning Japanese at a basic level, and consists of three different pages: One for <a href="Basics.html">Basics</a>, one for <a href="Hiragana.html">Hiragana</a>, and one for <a href="Katakana.html">Katakana</a>. The website will mostly consist of tips that will help as an introduction to learning Japanese, however, please keep in mind that this is a website made for absolute begginers, and will only provide simple information. It is recommended to go to the <a href="Basics.html">Basics</a> page first, where you will find brief information regarding getting into the language.  </b1>
