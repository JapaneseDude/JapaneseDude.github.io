<p>Japanese can be a frustrating and difficult language to learn, but hopefully, with these tips and tricks, you can start your journey to becoming fluent in the Japanese language.</p>
    
<p>First and foremost, learning a foreign language, especially an asian language, can be quite difficult. Even getting to conversation-level will take a fair amount of practice and time, and again, is not an easy thing to do. If you are willing to invest your time and are truly determined to learn the language, you have my respects. However, if you are not willing to practice consistently and/or do not have the time to do so, I do not recommend learning Japanese, or any language for that matter.</p>

<p>like anything, learning Japanese will take a lot of repeating and remembering and, again, a decent amount of time. One thing most people struggle with when learning Japanese, is the pronunciation/wording. A useful thing to remember when learning Japanese, is that other than the rare exception, each character is equivalent to one syllable, and will end with a vowel sound. This will become useful when you begin to learn the basic alphabets of Japanese (Hiragana and Katakana), and throughout the early stages of learning the language.</p>
    
<p>One of the first things you should learn when starting Japanese, is how to read and pronounce Hiragana. tips and tricks regarding Hiragana will be provided on the <a href="Hiragana.html">Hiragana Page</a>. Because Hiragana is the main alphabet of Japanese, without learning it, you will not be able to advance. </p>
    
    
<p>One of, if not the most important things to do when learning Japanese is to work on pronunciations first. Though it may be tempting to dive straight into the language, pronunciation is one of the most important things to learn, as without it, you will not be able to properly understand nor speak the language. Though it may be difficult at first, practicing it early will prove rewarding later on, when you get into basic speaking and listening.</p>
    
<div class="header">It will take some time...</div>
        
<p>Though there may be many useful tips and tricks that can help when learning a language, ultimately, it comes down to constant practice and revision. There are many websites that could help you with learning Japanese, but one of the best in my opinion, is <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/">Tofugu</a>. Though such websites may make learning  easier, I would like to emphasise that learning something, especially a language, <i>will</i> take time, especially if you wish to become properly fluent in the language.</p>
